This is caused by DNA mutations that are (for the most part) acquired spontaneously or induced by environmental insults. These genetic but also epigenetic changes alter the expression or function of key genes that regulate fundamental cellular processes, such as growth, survival, and senescence, resulting in an abnormal growth.

comment: as hematopoiesis comprises different cell types (red blood cells\, leukocytes and platelets)\, also mention of individual type of cells (e.g. erythorid cells\, magakaryocytes) can occur in specific studies/reports. It is necessary to refer to the study report to understand the use of the specific terminologies\, without other indications such as \"increased\"\, \"decreased\" and similar.

The principal functions of B cells are to make antibodies against antigens, perform the role of Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) and eventually develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. B cells are an essential component of the adaptive immune system. T cells belong to a group of white blood cells known as lymphocytes, and play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. They can be distinguished from other lymphocyte types, such as B cells and natural killer cells by the presence of a special receptor on their cell surface called T cell receptors (TCR). The abbreviation T, in T cell, stands for thymus, since this is the principal organ responsible for the T cell's maturation. Several different subsets of T cells have been discovered, each with a distinct function" []

comment: Within the respiratory tract\, metaplasia is used to denote a major cell type not normally resident at the junction of terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts\, or in the upper respiratory tract. It may replace the respiratory and/or the alveolar epithelium by squamous cells and needs to be differentiated from neoplastic changes. In the upper airways may be more comonly observed as some areas (e.g. laryngeal sites) are more susceptible to it\, although here is more often reversible. Within the urinary tract\, squamous metaplasia of the urothelium may occur in the renal pelvis\, the urinary bladder and the urethra.

Adenomyosis has been induced in mice with hormone (estrogen and/or progesterone) modulators and other xenobiotics inducing hyperprolactinemia" []
comment: In other species\, adenomyosis is a medical condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue (the inner lining of the uterus) within the myometrium (the thick\, muscular layer of the uterus). Often it is considered a consequence of malformation (ectopia) although can be also seen in hyperplastic conditions of the endometrium (e.g. bitch with endometrial cystic hyperplasia).

Lens fibers can undergo degeneration with various abnormal features, including separation, swelling, granularity, condensation, fragmentation, and disruption of the normally orderly configuration, as well as abnormal retention of lens fiber nuclei in several swollen lens fibers. It recognizes different causes, including heredity, trauma, metabolic disease, nutritional imbalance, environmental factors, increased intraocular pressure, aging, and excessive exposure to ionizing radiation or ambient light."

def: "Vacuolation of cardiomyocytes can present a terminology challenge.  Light microscopic vacuolar changes are most often associated with an abnormal accumulation of energy substrates (e.g. lipid), altered processing of phospholipid membranes (e.g. phospholipidosis), or enlargement/dilation of cellular organelles (e.g. mitochondrial, ER).   These changes often involve some alteration of cellular function (so could be considered ¿degenerative¿) that can be very difficult to characterize with either changes in cellular morphology, contractile, or electrical function."

def: "single cell necrosis is often interchangeble with apotosis or apoptotic necrosis, as they all are usually represented by individual cells dying of via an apototic process. Apoptosis is a form of genetically controlled 'programmed cell death'. Typical microscopic appearance includes condensed eosinophilic cytoplasm with maintenance of membrane integrity, cytoplasmic budding, nuclear fragmentation in the absence of an inflammatory response.  Diagnosis may be confirmed by electron microscopy, immunostaining (e.g. activated caspase 3) or TUNEL staining. It can occur spontaneously, or be induced by xenobiotics." []

name: dilation\, tubule
def: "Increased luminal diameter of seminiferous tubules, usually secondary to impaired fluid reabsorption in the efferent ducts/caput epididymis, distal obstruction in excurrent duct system (rete testis, efferent ducts, or initial segment), increased secretion of seminiferous tubule fluid by Sertoli cells, or inhibition of peritubular contractions, resulting in increased seminiferous tubular fluid."

def: "In rats, Harderian gland alteration can be observed in the extraorbital lacrimal gland of male and female rats at three months of age, but increases at six month of age only in males. This process appears to be androgen-dependent but also influenced by the absence of estrogen receptors on lacrimal gland acinar epithelial cells in male rats after six months of age (Ferrara et al. 2004). Conversely in mice, females are more frequently affected than males (Krinke 1996). It remains unclear whether this change reflects a metaplastic or a degenerative change. It appears that the Harderian gland cells develop from undifferentiated basal cells of the lacrimal gland acini and intercalated and excretory ducts (Sashima et al. 1989)." []

In the GI tract they can relate to the ingesta content, and not necessary to an alteration of the muscular tone or GI motility. Another common distention occurs in the uterus horns in cycling rats. The change is a normal feature during the proestrus and estrus phase of the cycle, when the endometrial cells secrete a watery fluid under the influence of estrogen. Estrogenic compounds also can induce such a distention of the uterine horns." []

The nature of the change therefore needs often a further characterization via special stains (Oil red O or Sudan Black on cryostat sections can demonstrate fat /EM can detect organelle swelling). Fatty change is accepted as a diagnosis only for liver. Fatty change can also be observed in combination with other hepatotoxic injuries (e.g., chronic liver toxicity, degeneration, inflammation, and necrosis) or nutritional disturbance (e.g. diet, vitamin A excess) in both animals and man."

name: accumulation\, glycogen
def: "Irregular and poorly defined clear spaces in the cytoplasm (rarefaction) usually with centrally located nuclei; positive stained with periodic acid-Schiff staining." []
comment: Glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes is a type of cytoplasmic alteration manifested on H&E-stained paraffin sections as clear spaces in the cytoplasm and a centrally located nucleus. Intracellular accumulation of glycogen is a normal physiological response following food ingestion. Since rodents eat primarily in the evening hours\, the largest amount of glycogen will be present during early morning hours. Intrahepatocyte glycogen is mobilized throughout the day\, initially being removed from centrilobular hepatocytes. Consequently the amount present varies depending upon whether the animals were fasted and on the time of necropsy during the day. Failure to accumulate glycogen because of inanition or abnormal glycogen retention may result from treatment-induced metabolic perturbations

comment: Mucous cell metaplasia and hyperplasia of respiratory epithelium are distinguished by anatomic location; significant numbers of mucous cells are not normally present in transitional epithelial zone of rodent nasal mucosa or in the bronchiolo-alveolar junctions.

def: "The menstrual cycle occurs in humans and non-human, anthropoid primates. Like the oestrous cycle of other mammals, events of the menstrual cycle reflect ovarian cyclicity but the starting days of the ovarian and menstrual cycles differ. The first day of vaginal discharge of blood is considered Day 1 of the menstrual cycle. The entire menstrual cycle includes three phases. The first phase, menstruation, is the interval during which micro- or macroscopically detectable blood is discharged vaginally due to the break-down and shedding of the endometrium. Endometrial breakdown is triggered when ovarian steroid hormone levels fall with the demise of the corpus luteum in the absence of pregnancy.

The pathogenesis of these sporadic lesions\nis not known. Experimentally, these metaplastic hepatic foci within the rat exocrine pancreas may be induced by several protocols." []
comment: An increase in metaplastic hepatic foci in toxicological studies may also be due to the result of test article-induced pancreatic atrophy and subsequent hepatic transdifferentiation.

def: "In the testis, single, large vacuoles (macrovacuolation) within the tubular epithelium at any level of seminiferous epithelium, or multiple, small, vacuoles (microvacuolation) generally within the basal Sertoli cell cytoplasm." []
comment: Occasional solitary vacuoles can be seen as an incidental finding in most control testes. This diagnosis should only be used when the number of vacuoles is above control levels. Vacuolation is generally an early morphological indicator of disturbance to the Sertoli cell. The vacuoles may be intracellular or intercellular and in both cases probably reflect a disturbance in fluid balance of the Sertoli cell. Microvacuolation of the\nbasal Sertoli cell cytoplasm occurs with some Sertoli cell toxicants and with some phospholipidosis-inducing chemicals. Significant germ cell degeneration and necrosis are often accompanied by vacuolation of the tubular epithelium\, secondary to the loss of the space occupying germ cell from between the Sertoli cell processes. Tubular vacuolation should only be used as a diagnosis when the vacuolation is considered\na primary or separate event

It is usually characterized by discrete, well demarcated increased cytoplasmic vacuolation of cortical cells with gradual transition to the surrounding cortex at the periphery.It usually occurs in one or more zones of the cortex, such as the zona fasciculata or glomerulosa. Individual cells may be increased in size, but the number of cells within the lesion is not increased. Slight to marked compression and increase in size beyond the regular cortical thickness may occur when combined with degenerative changes such as sinusoid dilatation and cystic degeneration." []

comment: In house mice the juxtamedullary X-zone of the adrenal cortex involutes rapidly at puberty in males\, and during their first pregnancy in females. In virgin females the zone degenerates more slowly\, at a rate dependent on genotype. Alteration in the normal response to the sexual hormones due to altered secretion or altered receptor pattern can influence the involution of this zone (GoRENI http\://www.goreni.org/)

comment: Once the tissue is removed from the body it will go through a process of self-destruction. This process is known as Autolysis ¿ which starts soon after the cell death creating an enzyme attack\, which in place causes the breakdown of protein and eventual liquefaction of the cell. Autolysis is more severe in tissues which are rich in enzymes\, such as the liver\, brain and kidney\, and is less rapid in tissues such as elastic fibers and collagen.

def: "Lymphatic sinus ectasia can involve both the medullary and subcapsular sinuses. Diffuse sinus ectasia is typically associated with lymphoid atrophy. This lesion can be found in control animals, especially in the mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes of ageing mice." []
comment: This lesion is characterized by the presence of dilated or cystic sinuses lined by lymphendothelium and filled with pale eosinophilic/amphophilic material (presumably lymph) that has a delicate lacy appearance. A few lymphocytes\, plasma cells and macrophages can be found admixed with the lymph.

name: inflammation\, vascular/perivascular
def: "Vasculitides refer to a varied group of disorders which all share a common underlying problem of inflammation of blood vessels. Vasculopathies are interchangeably used to cover other disorders, when the inflammatory process is not the dominant aspect of the vascular change. The process may affect any size blood vessel, anywhere in the body. They may affect either arteries and/or veins. They may be focal, meaning that they affect a single location within a vessel; or they may be widespread, with areas of inflammation scattered throughout a particular organ or tissue, or even affecting more than one organ system in the body. Some vasculitides/vasculopathies recognize specific mechanisms, some others have no identifiable initiating event." []
comment: The use of the two terms (vasculitis and vasculopathy) have been historically discouraged in toxicological pathology\, as their use\, in association with the vessel and/or the anatomical region affected\, may inherently imply a similarity to specific human conditions\, which is often not the case. In line with this\, all these terms have been mapped under the morphological descriptor \"vascular/perivascular inflammation\"

name: mineralization
def: "mineralization is usually a pathological calcification occurring as abnormal deposition of calcium salts within soft tissues; less commonly composed of magnesium salts, phosphorus, glycoprotein." []
comment: Usually it is differentiated into \"dystrophic calcification\" when occurring in dying tissues\, or in \"metastatic calcification\" when occurring in condition of hypercalemia. Nevertheless\, small calcium deposits may occur in otherwise normal tissues/organs\, without implying the aforementioned mechanisms.

This is a nonspecific change that may be observed in aged rats (Greaves and Faccini 1984) and only occasionally observed in mice (Faccini et al. 1990).  Administration of allylamine or phosphodiesterase inhibitors can induce this lesion in rats (Berridge et al. 2013).\n\nThis lesion is not generally thought to be a ¿pre-cursor¿ to neoplasia.  Accordingly\, ¿proliferation¿ is preferred to ¿hyperplasia¿ to communicate the distinction from those processes that do have more pre-neoplastic potential.

This can also be an artifact that results from euthanasia or tissue dissection during necropsy, especially in the bronchial or mediastinal lymph nodes. The trimming and sectioning of lymph node tissue can also dislodge erythrocytes from congested\nblood vessels, which can then appear in the sinusoids or in the perinodal region. Lymph nodes draining sites of hemorrhage can also have intrasinusoidal erythrocytes but, depending on chronicity, they can be accompanied by variable numbers of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, erythrophagocytosis and inflammatory cells (Elmore .Tox Path 2006 )" []

Diffuse hyperplasia may be induced by chemicals\n(e.g. Misprostal) or by larval (Taenia taeniaeformis) infestation in the liver. The incidence of mitotic figures at the base of the gastric pit and the ratio of the lengths of the foveolus (gastric pit) to the deeper oxyntic region can be indices of proliferative activity; however\, the latter will normally increase moving distally from the squamocolumnar junction.
